# Base Laravel API with Authentication, Roles, Permissions and Logs

---

## Overview

This project offers a foundational Laravel API with built-in authentication, role-based access control, and permission management. It also features detailed request logging, configurable via the `LOG_GET_REQUESTS` environment variable to enable or disable logging of GET requests.

## How to Start the Project

1. **Ensure Required Tools**:

    - PHP (>= 8.3)
    - Composer
    - A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite)

2. **Clone the Repository**:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/KauanCalheiro/base_laravel_api.git
    ```

3. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

    ```bash
    cd base_laravel_api
    ```

4. **Install Dependencies**:

    ```bash
    composer install
    ```

5. **Configure Environment**:

    - Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`:
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    - Edit the `.env` file to configure your database credentials and other environment variables as needed.

6. **Generate Application Key**:

    ```bash
    php artisan key:generate
    ```

7. **Run Migrations**:

    - Set up the database tables:
        ```bash
        php artisan migrate
        ```

8. **Seed Initial Data** (Optional):

    - Populate the database with default roles and permissions (if included):
        ```bash
        php artisan db:seed
        ```

9. **Start the Development Server**:

    ```bash
    php artisan serve
    ```

10. **Access the Application**:
    - Open your browser and navigate to: `http://127.0.0.1:8000`

## Features

-   **Authentication**:
    -   User registration and login.
    -   Password hashing and reset functionality.
-   **Roles and Permissions**:
    -   Predefined roles (e.g., Admin, User) with associated permissions.
    -   Middleware to secure routes based on roles and permissions.
-   **Request Logging**:
    -   Logs request details including `user`, `method`, `path`, `query`, `body`, `headers`, `IP address`, `user agent`, `response status`, `execution time (in ms) ` and `response`.
    -   Configurable via an environment variable `LOG_GET_REQUESTS` to enable or disable logging of GET requests. Set `LOG_GET_REQUESTS=false`(default) to disable logging of GET requests and `LOG_GET_REQUESTS=true` to enable logging of all requests.
-   **Dynamic Query Relations**:
    -   Enables dynamic inclusion of relationships in API responses using URL parameters.
    -   Use the `with[]` parameter to specify relationships.  
        Example: `GET {{URL}}/user?with[]=permissions&with[]=roles` includes user permissions and roles in the response.
    -   Supports nested relationships.  
        Example: `GET {{URL}}/user?with[]=roles.permissions` fetches roles and their associated permissions.
    -   Custom handling for the `user` model, while other models use a generalized approach.
    -   Implemented via the `Relationable` trait for seamless integration.
-   **API Documentation**:
    -   Exportable Postman collection for testing endpoints.

## Importing the Collection into Postman

1. **Install Postman**:

    - If not already installed, download [Postman](https://www.postman.com/).

2. **Locate the Collection File**:

    - Find the `postman-requests.json` file in the project root directory.

3. **Import the Collection**:

    - Open Postman.
    - Click on **Import** in the main menu.
    - Select the `postman-requests.json` file and click **Import**.

4. **Set Up Environment Variables**:

    - Configure the Postman environment variables (e.g., `{{URL}}`) to match your applicationâ€™s base URL.

5. **Test Endpoints**:
    - Use the imported collection to test the API endpoints.

## Notes and Best Practices

-   **Environment Variables**:

    -   Ensure the `.env` file is correctly configured for your local environment and does not contain sensitive information when shared.

-   **Database**:

    -   Backup your database before running migrations or seeders.

-   **API Base URL**:

    -   Replace `{{URL}}` in Postman with your application's base URL.

-   **Code Customization**:
    -   Extend the existing roles and permissions as per your application's requirements.
